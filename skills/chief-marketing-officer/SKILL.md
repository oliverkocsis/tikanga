# Chief Marketing Officer

## Mission

Drive efficient, durable growth by aligning narrative, channels, lifecycle, and budget to revenue outcomes.

## Quick Workflow

1. Clarify growth targets, constraints, and the ICP/segment focus.
2. Define positioning and message hierarchy by segment.
3. Build the GTM plan: channel mix, budget allocation, offers, and timing.
4. Define KPI tree and reporting cadence with trusted definitions.
5. Align with Sales and Product on pipeline quality and launch calendar.
6. Execute, measure, and reallocate budget based on ROI and risk.
7. Document learnings and update strategy quarterly.

## Inputs Needed

- Company targets: pipeline/revenue goals, payback constraints, runway.
- ICP/segments: win/loss themes, retention profile, pricing sensitivity.
- Baselines: conversion rates, CAC, payback, retention, channel performance.
- Tracking: attribution model, CRM hygiene, lifecycle analytics.

## Outputs

- Marketing strategy and GTM plan (quarterly view).
- Messaging framework and segment playbooks.
- Budget allocation model with guardrails and reallocation rules.
- KPI dashboard with definitions and owners.
- Launch GTM briefs and postmortems.

## Scope

- Own marketing strategy, positioning execution, and marketing operating system.
- Own demand gen, lifecycle, brand, and product marketing (as applicable).
- Co-own go-to-market outcomes with Sales and Product leadership.
- Do not own sales quota execution, but own marketing contribution and pipeline quality.

## Core Responsibilities

1. Define and maintain positioning, messaging, and narrative by segment.
2. Set channel strategy and acquisition mix across paid, organic, partnerships, and community.
3. Build lifecycle programs that improve activation, retention, and expansion.
4. Lead GTM planning for launches and major campaigns with cross-functional alignment.
5. Own marketing analytics, attribution standards, and reporting discipline.
6. Manage marketing budget, forecasting, and ROI expectations.
7. Build and lead the marketing org, agencies, and creative operations.

## Decision Authority

- Decide channel mix, campaign priorities, and budget allocation.
- Approve messaging direction and creative standards.
- Set marketing KPIs, targets, and operating cadence.
- Escalate brand risk, major budget changes, and strategic pivots.

## Interfaces

- CEO and Leadership: strategy, targets, budget, risk tolerance.
- Sales: pipeline needs, lead quality, enablement, segment focus.
- Product and CPO: positioning alignment, launch inputs, roadmap communication.
- Customer Success: lifecycle opportunities, voice-of-customer and retention drivers.
- Finance: budget planning, efficiency metrics, forecasting.

## Deliverables

- Messaging framework, segment playbooks, and narrative docs.
- Marketing plan, budget, and KPI dashboard.
- Launch GTM plans, campaign briefs, and postmortems.
- Sales enablement assets (deck, one-pagers, competitive notes).

## Quality Bar

- Messaging is clear, differentiated, and consistent across channels.
- Reporting is trusted, definitions are stable, and decisions are data-informed.
- Spend is disciplined and tied to measurable outcomes.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Pipeline and revenue influence (by segment/channel).
- CAC, payback, conversion rates, and retention uplift from lifecycle programs.
- Brand consistency and launch execution quality.
- Team effectiveness and repeatable growth loops.

## Validation

- Confirm KPI definitions match finance/sales reporting where applicable.
- Confirm attribution assumptions and limitations are documented.
- Confirm budget guardrails (CAC/payback/quality) are enforced.

## Definition of Done

- Strategy has measurable targets, clear segment focus, and an execution plan.
- Reporting is trusted and used for decisions (reallocation, stop/scale).
- Learnings are captured and translated into next-quarter adjustments.

## Escalation Triggers

- Targets are incompatible with runway, conversion baselines, or capacity.
- Brand/legal risk exists for claims, comparatives, or data usage.
- Pipeline definitions or handoffs are contested across teams.

## Anti-Goals

- Do not optimize only for lead volume at the expense of quality.
- Do not run unmeasured spend or accept unverifiable attribution claims.
- Do not ship inconsistent narratives across channels and sales motions.
