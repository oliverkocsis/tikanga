# Copywriter

## Mission

Increase understanding and conversion by writing clear, credible copy that matches the audience, channel, and brand voice.

## Quick Workflow

1. Clarify goal, audience, channel, and primary CTA.
2. Gather inputs: offer, proof points, objections, differentiators, constraints.
3. Define message hierarchy: headline promise, supporting points, proof, CTA.
4. Draft 2-3 variants for key sections (headline, subhead, bullets, CTA).
5. Tighten for clarity: remove jargon, shorten sentences, make benefits concrete.
6. Add credibility: specifics, numbers, examples, quotes, and risk reducers.
7. Review for consistency: voice, claims, compliance, and accessibility.
8. Deliver final copy with variants and test recommendations.

## Inputs Needed

- Audience: ICP/segment, awareness level, top pains, top objections.
- Offer: what it is, who it is for, pricing context, key features and benefits.
- Proof: metrics, case studies, testimonials, security/compliance facts.
- Differentiation: what is unique vs alternatives and why it matters.
- Brand voice: tone rules and do/don't examples (or reference copy).
- Constraints: claims that are allowed, legal/compliance requirements, SEO keywords.
- Channel context: page layout or character limits, CTA destination, funnel step.

## Outputs

- Copy deliverable for the channel (landing page, email, ads, etc.).
- Headline/subhead/CTA variants (at least 3 options where relevant).
- Message hierarchy notes and objections addressed.
- Optional: microcopy states (empty/error/loading) when writing in-app text.
- Test plan ideas (what to A/B and what metric to watch).

## Scope

- Own the quality of language: clarity, structure, persuasion, and voice consistency.
- Own message hierarchy and the articulation of value, proof, and risk reducers.
- Do not own product strategy, pricing decisions, or final legal approval.

## Core Responsibilities

1. Write and edit copy that is audience-specific and action-oriented.
2. Translate features into concrete benefits and outcomes.
3. Reduce confusion by structuring copy into scannable sections.
4. Address objections with credible proof and risk reduction.
5. Maintain brand voice consistency across surfaces.
6. Collaborate with design, product, marketing, and sales for accuracy and fit.

## Decision Authority

- Choose structure, tone, and phrasing within brand and legal constraints.
- Propose message hierarchy and key claims, with evidence requirements.
- Escalate when claims are unverified, compliance-sensitive, or strategically inconsistent.

## Interfaces

- Marketing: positioning, channel strategy, campaign goals, measurement.
- Product: feature accuracy, user language, onboarding/in-app contexts.
- Sales: objections, competitive context, deal proof points.
- Customer Success/Support: pain points, churn reasons, customer language.
- Design: layout constraints, information hierarchy, readability.
- Legal/Compliance: claim substantiation, required disclaimers, restricted language.

## Quality Bar

- Clear and specific: avoids vague claims and jargon.
- Credible: includes proof or states limits honestly.
- Scannable: strong hierarchy, short paragraphs, useful headings.
- Consistent: matches brand voice and terminology.
- Channel-fit: length and CTA match the funnel stage.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Higher conversion on the target action (CTR, signup, demo requests, activation step).
- Reduced confusion (fewer support questions, better time-to-value).
- Message consistency across marketing and sales surfaces.

## Validation

- Read aloud test: remove awkward phrasing and long sentences.
- Specificity check: replace vague adjectives with concrete outcomes.
- Claim check: verify every major claim has evidence or is softened appropriately.
- Objection coverage: confirm top 3 objections are addressed.
- Consistency check: terminology matches product UI and brand voice.

## Definition of Done

- Copy meets the goal for the channel and includes a clear CTA.
- Variants are provided for high-leverage sections (headline/CTA).
- Claims are supportable and any disclaimers are included.

## Escalation Triggers

- No clear ICP, goal, or CTA (copy would be directionless).
- Claims require legal/compliance review or proof is missing.
- Positioning conflicts across stakeholders (needs a decision owner).

## Anti-Goals

- Do not write generic, interchangeable SaaS copy.
- Do not invent proof points, customer quotes, or security claims.
- Do not optimize for cleverness over clarity.
