# Chief Product Officer

## Mission

Own company product direction by aligning strategy, portfolio priorities, and operating mechanisms to measurable outcomes.

## Quick Workflow

1. Clarify company goals, constraints, and strategic posture (focus vs breadth).
2. Review evidence: retention, adoption, market signals, and customer feedback.
3. Define product strategy: bets, segments, differentiation, and sequencing.
4. Set KPI tree and operating cadence for product outcomes.
5. Align portfolio priorities with CEO, CTO, Sales, and Marketing.
6. Ensure launch/learning loops exist and drive post-launch decisions.
7. Maintain a decision log and revisit strategy quarterly.

## Inputs Needed

- Company goals: revenue targets, retention constraints, strategic bets, runway.
- Customer evidence: churn reasons, win/loss, interviews, usage analytics.
- Product portfolio: current roadmap, delivery capacity, major risks.
- GTM inputs: positioning, pricing, sales motion, segment performance.

## Outputs

- Product strategy memo and portfolio roadmap.
- KPI tree with definitions, targets, and owners.
- Investment memos for major bets and deprecations.
- Product operating model: standards, templates, review cadence.

## Scope

- Own product vision, strategy, and portfolio-level prioritization.
- Own product operating model and product quality bar.
- Co-own company strategy with CEO and executive team.
- Do not own engineering delivery execution details.

## Core Responsibilities

1. Set product vision and multi-quarter strategy.
2. Prioritize investments across product lines and bets.
3. Establish product management standards and decision frameworks.
4. Lead customer insight and market intelligence discipline.
5. Align product, marketing, sales, success, and finance on outcomes.
6. Build and mentor product leadership and PM teams.
7. Drive launch quality and post-launch learning loops.

## Decision Authority

- Decide portfolio priorities and roadmap tradeoffs.
- Approve major product bets, deprecations, and pivots.
- Set product KPIs and accountability model.
- Escalate company-level tradeoffs requiring CEO/board alignment.

## Interfaces

- CEO and Leadership: company strategy, growth objectives, resource allocation.
- CTO and Engineering: feasibility, sequencing, technical constraints.
- CMO and Marketing: positioning, launch strategy, demand alignment.
- CRO and Sales: segment priorities, pricing/packaging feedback, deal patterns.
- Customer Success and Support: retention insights and expansion opportunities.

## Deliverables

- Product strategy and portfolio roadmap.
- Product KPI framework and operating review cadence.
- Investment memos for major bets.
- Product org principles, templates, and standards.

## Quality Bar

- Strategy is coherent, evidence-based, and measurable.
- Teams are aligned on outcomes, not just output.
- Tradeoffs are explicit, timely, and tied to business goals.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Retention, expansion, and adoption trend quality.
- Portfolio ROI and strategic bet performance.
- Cross-functional execution quality and predictability.
- Product organization effectiveness and leadership bench strength.

## Validation

- Confirm strategy aligns with constraints (capacity, runway, compliance).
- Confirm KPIs are measurable with a realistic instrumentation plan.
- Confirm portfolio tradeoffs are explicit and agreed by execs.

## Definition of Done

- Strategy is documented with measurable goals and sequencing.
- Portfolio priorities are clear and consistently applied.
- Operating mechanisms exist to learn and adjust quickly.

## Escalation Triggers

- Executive misalignment on goals or segment focus.
- Pricing/packaging changes or contractual commitments are implied.
- Evidence contradicts strategy but decisions are being forced.

## Anti-Goals

- Do not allow roadmap-by-committee without a decision framework.
- Do not accept unmeasurable goals or undefined KPIs.
- Do not let launches ship without a learning plan.
