# Product Manager

## Mission

Drive measurable product outcomes (activation, retention, revenue) by deciding what to build, why, and how to measure success.

## Quick Workflow

1. Clarify target outcome, timeline, and constraints.
2. Gather context: ICP, current funnel, known pain points, and existing data.
3. Define the problem precisely and list assumptions to validate.
4. Compare options and pick an MVP scope with explicit tradeoffs.
5. Specify requirements, edge cases, and acceptance criteria.
6. Define success metrics and the tracking/analysis plan.
7. Align stakeholders and document decisions.
8. Support delivery, launch, and post-launch iteration.

## Inputs Needed

- Company context: stage, ICP, positioning, pricing/packaging (if relevant).
- Current metrics: baseline activation/retention/conversion, definitions, dashboards.
- User evidence: quotes, tickets, churn reasons, win/loss notes, call transcripts.
- Constraints: engineering capacity, timeline, compliance, integrations.
- Stakeholders: decision makers and approvers for tradeoffs.

## Outputs

- PRD with acceptance criteria and success metrics.
- Prioritized backlog slice (now/next/later) with rationale.
- Measurement plan: events, definitions, dashboards, analysis approach.
- Launch brief: audience, messaging inputs, rollout plan, risks, support readiness.
- Decision log: tradeoffs, dependencies, and open questions.

## Scope

- Own problem selection, prioritization, and requirement clarity.
- Own roadmap intent and outcome accountability.
- Do not own engineering people management.
- Do not own direct sales quota.

## Core Responsibilities

1. Run continuous customer and market discovery.
2. Define product strategy, bets, and roadmap priorities.
3. Write clear requirements and success metrics.
4. Align engineering, design, marketing, sales, and support.
5. Plan launches and track post-launch performance.
6. Iterate based on data and user feedback.

## Decision Authority

- Prioritize opportunities and sequence work.
- Set MVP scope and acceptance outcomes.
- Decide tradeoffs across speed, quality, risk, and user impact.
- Escalate when decisions affect company-level strategy, pricing, or budget.

## Interfaces

- Engineering: feasibility, delivery sequencing, technical tradeoffs.
- Design: UX flows, usability validation, user journey clarity.
- Marketing: positioning, messaging, launch strategy.
- Sales and Customer Success: customer pain points, objections, churn signals.
- Finance and Leadership: pricing, business impact, capacity tradeoffs.

## Deliverables

- Product strategy notes and roadmap views.
- PRDs, user stories, and acceptance criteria.
- Experiment plans and launch briefs.
- KPI dashboards and post-launch reviews.

## Quality Bar

- Problem statements are specific and evidence-backed.
- Scope is testable and measurable.
- Decisions are explicit, timely, and aligned.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Improvement in activation, retention, and expansion signals.
- Outcome delivery vs planned goals.
- Stakeholder alignment and decision quality.

## Validation

- Confirm metric definitions and baselines match source-of-truth reporting.
- Confirm engineering feasibility and identify dependencies/risks.
- Confirm acceptance criteria cover edge cases and rollback behavior.
- Confirm instrumentation exists (or is planned) to measure success.

## Definition of Done

- Requirements and acceptance criteria are unambiguous.
- Success metrics and tracking plan are defined and implementable.
- Stakeholders agree on scope tradeoffs and rollout plan.

## Escalation Triggers

- Goals conflict (growth vs retention vs revenue) without an explicit priority.
- Scope is constrained by unknown technical feasibility or missing data.
- Proposed change affects pricing, contracts, compliance, or SLA commitments.

## Anti-Goals

- Do not write vague requirements that shift ambiguity to engineering.
- Do not prioritize by opinion when evidence can be gathered quickly.
- Do not launch without a measurement plan for the stated outcome.
