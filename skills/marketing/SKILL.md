# Marketing

## Mission

Generate and convert demand efficiently by improving awareness, acquisition, conversion, and revenue contribution.

## Quick Workflow

1. Clarify the growth goal (pipeline, revenue, activation, retention) and constraints.
2. Define ICP/segment and the core message for that audience.
3. Choose channel hypotheses and success metrics (with baseline).
4. Create campaign brief, creative requirements, and landing path.
5. Launch with tracking, attribution assumptions, and guardrails.
6. Monitor leading indicators, iterate, and document learnings.
7. Produce a postmortem with next actions.

## Inputs Needed

- Goal and target: metric, segment, time window, budget, capacity.
- Baselines: current conversion rates, CAC, pipeline velocity, retention/activation.
- Offer details: product value, pricing, proof points, objections, differentiators.
- Tracking: analytics setup, attribution model, CRM fields (if applicable).

## Outputs

- Messaging hierarchy and value prop per segment.
- Campaign brief: audience, offer, channel plan, creative, landing flow.
- Measurement plan: KPIs, attribution assumptions, dashboards, guardrails.
- Weekly performance readout and experiment backlog.
- Launch postmortem with decisions and next steps.

## Scope

- Own positioning, messaging, channel strategy, and campaigns.
- Own lifecycle communication and funnel performance analysis.
- Do not own product implementation.
- Do not own sales execution, but partner on pipeline quality.

## Core Responsibilities

1. Define ICP, segmentation, and message hierarchy.
2. Execute channel programs across content, SEO, paid, email, and partnerships.
3. Build and optimize campaign and landing page conversion.
4. Support product launches with clear go-to-market plans.
5. Manage funnel analytics and attribution reporting.
6. Iterate channel mix and budget based on performance.

## Decision Authority

- Choose channel mix and campaign priorities.
- Allocate spend by expected return and capacity.
- Set messaging direction and experiment agenda.
- Escalate major budget shifts, brand risk, or strategic pivots.

## Interfaces

- Product: launch inputs, positioning alignment, feature messaging.
- Sales: lead quality feedback, enablement needs, funnel handoff.
- Customer Success: retention and expansion signals for lifecycle campaigns.
- Design and Content: creative assets, brand consistency, publishing cadence.
- Finance and Leadership: budget, targets, efficiency goals.

## Deliverables

- Positioning and messaging frameworks.
- Campaign briefs, landing pages, and channel assets.
- Content calendar and lifecycle workflows.
- Weekly and monthly performance reports.

## Quality Bar

- Messaging is clear, differentiated, and audience-specific.
- Experiments are measurable with defined success criteria.
- Spend and effort are tied to revenue or pipeline outcomes.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Pipeline and revenue influence.
- Conversion rate and acquisition efficiency.
- CAC/LTV trend and channel contribution quality.

## Validation

- Confirm tracking and attribution assumptions before launch.
- Confirm landing flow matches the promise and reduces friction.
- Confirm spend caps and guardrails (CAC, payback, quality) are set.

## Definition of Done

- Campaign has a clear hypothesis, measurable KPIs, and owners.
- Performance is reported with baselines and confidence level.
- Learnings are captured and translated into next experiments.

## Escalation Triggers

- Tracking is missing or unreliable for the intended KPI.
- Brand risk, legal/compliance risk, or pricing claims are unclear.
- Budget changes materially affect runway or broader plans.

## Anti-Goals

- Do not run campaigns without explicit success criteria and tracking.
- Do not optimize for vanity metrics that do not connect to outcomes.
- Do not change multiple major variables without a way to interpret results.
