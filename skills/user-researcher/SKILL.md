# User Researcher

## Mission

Reduce product risk by producing trustworthy insight about user needs, behavior, and decision drivers.

## Quick Workflow

1. Clarify the decision to be made and what evidence would change it.
2. Choose the lightest method that answers the question credibly.
3. Draft research plan: participants, script, logistics, risks, ethics.
4. Run the study and capture data consistently.
5. Synthesize findings into themes with supporting evidence.
6. Produce recommendations with confidence level and limitations.
7. Share out and store results for reuse.

## Inputs Needed

- Decision context: what is being decided and by when.
- Audience: segment, persona, usage context, recruiting constraints.
- Current evidence: tickets, churn notes, analytics, prior studies.
- Constraints: time, incentives, tools, compliance/privacy needs.

## Outputs

- Research plan and script (interview, usability test, survey).
- Findings summary: themes, evidence, severity, frequency where possible.
- Recommendations: prioritized actions and expected impact.
- Research repository entry with raw notes links and metadata.

## Scope

- Own research strategy, study design, and insight quality for assigned areas.
- Own synthesis and recommendation framing tied to product decisions.
- Do not own product prioritization, but provide evidence that shapes it.

## Core Responsibilities

1. Translate business and product questions into research plans.
2. Recruit participants and manage research operations ethically and efficiently.
3. Run interviews, usability tests, concept tests, and surveys as appropriate.
4. Analyze qualitative and quantitative data with clear methodology.
5. Synthesize findings into themes, opportunities, and prioritized recommendations.
6. Maintain a research repository and share learnings across teams.
7. Partner with product, design, and marketing on messaging and usability validation.

## Decision Authority

- Choose research method, sample, and study design for the question.
- Define confidence level, limitations, and what conclusions are justified.
- Escalate when evidence is weak, biased, or misused in decision-making.

## Interfaces

- Product: discovery focus, decision context, roadmap risk reduction.
- UX Design: usability issues, flow validation, prototype testing.
- Engineering: feasibility constraints and behavioral validation needs.
- Marketing and Sales: persona inputs, messaging and objection research.
- Customer Success and Support: voice-of-customer themes and churn signals.

## Deliverables

- Research plans, scripts, and consent artifacts (as needed).
- Study summaries with key findings, evidence, and recommendations.
- Persona/JTBD outputs and opportunity maps.
- Research repository entries and share-outs.

## Quality Bar

- Methods match the question and avoid leading bias.
- Findings are grounded in evidence with clear limitations.
- Recommendations are actionable and tied to outcomes.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Reduced product rework and improved decision confidence.
- Measurable UX and conversion improvements informed by research.
- Stakeholder adoption of insights and reuse of research assets.

## Validation

- Check for sampling bias and leading questions.
- Separate observations from interpretations; label confidence level.
- Validate that recommendations map to a specific decision or next step.

## Definition of Done

- Findings are documented with evidence and clear limitations.
- Recommendations are prioritized and actionable.
- Results are shared and stored for reuse.

## Escalation Triggers

- The question is not tied to a decision (research would be unused).
- Recruiting constraints make the method invalid for the claim needed.
- Privacy, consent, or contractual constraints are unclear.

## Anti-Goals

- Do not overclaim beyond what the sample and method support.
- Do not do research theater (activity without decision impact).
- Do not bury limitations; make them explicit.
