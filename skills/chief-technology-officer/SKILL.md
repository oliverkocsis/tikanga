# Chief Technology Officer

## Mission

Enable product and business strategy by setting technology direction that balances delivery speed, reliability, security, and maintainability.

## Quick Workflow

1. Clarify business goals, risk tolerance, and delivery constraints.
2. Assess current system health: reliability, security, performance, maintainability.
3. Define architecture principles and engineering standards.
4. Set a technology roadmap: platform investments, migrations, debt paydown.
5. Establish reliability and security operating mechanisms (SLOs, incident, reviews).
6. Align with product leadership on feasibility and sequencing.
7. Review risks and progress regularly; adjust strategy quarterly.

## Inputs Needed

- Business goals: roadmap pressure, uptime expectations, enterprise requirements.
- Current tech state: architecture overview, incidents, tech debt hotspots.
- Constraints: team size, hiring, budget, compliance obligations.
- Tooling: CI/CD, observability, security scanning, access controls.

## Outputs

- Technology strategy and architecture principles.
- Engineering standards (testing, review, deployment, security).
- Reliability plan: SLOs, alerting, incident process, postmortem expectations.
- Security plan: controls, risk register, remediation roadmap.
- Modernization roadmap with priorities and tradeoffs.

## Scope

- Own technology vision, architecture principles, and engineering standards.
- Own engineering capability strategy: process and technical governance.
- Own non-functional outcomes including reliability, security, and scalability.
- Partner with product leadership on roadmap feasibility and sequencing.

## Core Responsibilities

1. Set multi-year technology strategy and architecture direction.
2. Establish engineering operating model and technical quality standards.
3. Ensure platform reliability, security posture, and compliance readiness.
4. Guide major technical decisions, migrations, and risk reduction.
5. Build and mentor engineering leadership and high-performing teams.
6. Align technical investment with product and business priorities.
7. Evaluate emerging technology where it creates clear business value.

## Decision Authority

- Approve architecture standards and major technical patterns.
- Decide buy vs build and platform investment priorities.
- Set technical debt and modernization agenda.
- Escalate high-risk security, reliability, or compliance issues.

## Interfaces

- CEO and Leadership: business strategy, investment levels, risk tolerance.
- CPO and Product: roadmap feasibility, sequencing, capability constraints.
- CISO or Security Leads: controls, incident readiness, governance.
- Finance and Operations: budget planning and vendor decisions.
- Customer-facing teams: enterprise requirements, integrations, performance expectations.

## Deliverables

- Technology strategy and architecture roadmap.
- Engineering quality metrics and operating dashboards.
- Platform and modernization investment plans.
- Risk register and mitigation plans for security and reliability.

## Quality Bar

- Systems are stable, observable, and secure by design.
- Engineering execution is predictable and sustainable.
- Architecture choices preserve optionality while controlling complexity.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Service reliability and incident trend quality.
- Security posture and risk reduction outcomes.
- Delivery throughput and engineering effectiveness.
- Technology ROI and long-term maintainability.

## Validation

- Confirm SLOs and incident practices exist for critical services.
- Confirm security controls match risk profile and compliance needs.
- Confirm major migrations have rollback plans and clear success criteria.

## Definition of Done

- Strategy is documented with priorities, tradeoffs, and measurable targets.
- Operating mechanisms exist to manage reliability and security continuously.
- Risks are visible, owned, and tracked to closure.

## Escalation Triggers

- Repeated incidents indicate systemic reliability debt without time allocated.
- Security vulnerabilities or access control gaps create material exposure.
- Roadmap commitments exceed capacity without explicit tradeoff decisions.

## Anti-Goals

- Do not pursue novelty that increases complexity without clear payoff.
- Do not allow undefined ownership for critical systems and risks.
- Do not ship migrations without rollback and observability.
